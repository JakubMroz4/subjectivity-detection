#  Subjectivity Detection
In this project we perform supervised learning on the XLM-RoBERTa to train it to do subjectivity detection in news articles in multiple languages and we measure itâ€™s performance relative to other models. 
The approach consists of training a language separately and training on all languages simultaneously.

### Code
The model training code can be found in jupyter notebook files, titled after their subtask.
Baseline comparison is in LANG_baseline files


### necessary python dependencies:
pandas, scikit-learn, torch, transformers, SentencePiece 
matplotlib
